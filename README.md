# Invisible-Cloak
Hello, Everyone Today we are going to do magic by writing the code in our code editor. So you have heard about Harry Potterâ€™s Invisible Cloak and wish to have one and go wherever you want to go and Experience what it feels like to be Invisible.

Pre-requisites: 1.Python version 3.0.0 or above
2.OpenCV(To install this we need to run a command which is discussed in further part)
3.Numpy(to handle all the operations)


IMPORTANT : : When you try to run this it takes 2 seconds to capture we selected in Step 2 time frame
the background so try not to be in the frame in the first 2 seconds and then you can simply test out your project.

Choose a cloth of one color only and suppose the color of the cloth is red then ensure that your background does not contain any red color. Because if the background contains that color then it will cause problems.
